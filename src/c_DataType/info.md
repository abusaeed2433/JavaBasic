# Data type
Defined in terms of three components
- A set of values
- A set of operations that can be applied
- A data representation, which determines how the values are stored

## built-in data types
A programming language provides some predefined data types, which are known as built-in data types.

## primitive data type
A data type that consists of an atomic, indivisible value, and that is defined without the help of any other data types, is known as a primitive data type.
- A programming language does not let the programmers extend primitive data types.
