# Classes and Object part-1
> Codes are in `partOne` package

## class
- Basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming paradigm(pattern),
- Ex: `Animal` is a class and `tiger` is an object of `Animal` class,

## Structure of JAVA class
```
<<modifiers>> class <<class name>> {
    // Body of the class goes here
}
```
- Modifiers:
  - `Keywords` that associate `special meanings` to the class declaration,
  - May have `zero or more modifiers`,
- Class name:
  - `User defined` class name,
  - Follows `Pascal Case` naming convention,
- Body of the class:
  - Contains `fields`, `methods`,
- Ex: (`Hooman.java`)
  ```
  public class Hooman {
    ...
  }
  ```
  - has `public` modifier,
  - class name is `Hooman`,
  - body contains `field`,`constructor` & some `methods`,


## Components of java class
- A class in Java may consist of `5` components:
- ### Field / variables
  - Represent properties or `attributes` of objects of that class,
  - `2` types of `fields` for a class:
    - #### Instance variables: 
      - `Non-static` variables,
      - Every object contains `separate copy` of these variables,
      - Must be `accessed using object` of the class,
      - Can be accessed using dot(`.`),
      - Ex: `obj.name;`,
    - #### Class variables:
      - `Static` variables,
      - Declared using the `static keyword` as a modifier,
      - Every object uses `same copy` of these variables,
      - `Shared among all objects` of this class,
      - Can be `called using class name`,
      - Can be accessed using dot(`.`) on both `object` and `class`,
      - Ex: `MyClass.count`,
  - `static` as well as `non-static` fields are initialized to a default value,
    - A `numeric` field (`int`, `long`, ...) is initialized to `zero(0)`,
    - A `boolean` field is initialized to `false`,
    - A `reference` type field is initialized to `null`,

- ### Method
  - Represent `behavior of objects` of the class,
  - More info is discussed below,

- ### Constructor
  - Used to `create objects` of the class,
  - More info is discussed below,

- ### Static initializer
  - For `initializing static variables` which need some `calculation`,

- ### Instance initializer,
  - For `initializing variables` which need some `calculation`,


## Understanding components
- `this` refers to `current instance`. More details is discussed next section,
- See `Hooman.java`,
  ```
  public class Hooman {
      // Field - 2 Class variables
      public static final String SPECIES;
      private static int objectCounter = 0;
  
      // Field - 3 instance variables
      private String name;
      private int age;
      private boolean isAdult;
  
      //static initializers - 1
      static {
          // normally more calculation is performed as per need
          SPECIES = "Homo Sapiens";
      }
  
      //instance initializers - 1
      {
          isAdult = false; // by default false though
      }
  

      //constructor - 1
      public Hooman() {
          objectCounter++;
      }
      //constructor - 2
      public Hooman(String name, int age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
          isAdult = age >= 18;
          objectCounter++;
      }
  
      // methods - 6 methods
      public String getName() {...}
      public void setName(String name) {...}
      public int getAge() {...}
      ...
  }
  ```

## Method again
- Represent `behavior` of objects of the class,
- Is a named `block of code`,
- Structure:
  ```
  <<modifiers>> <<return type>> <<method name>> (<<parameters list>>) <<throws clause>> {
    // Body of the method goes here
  }
  ```
- `Formal parameters` of a method are treated as local variables,
- `throws` is optional,
- Ex:
  ```
  public void setAge(int age) {
     if(age < 0 || age < this.age) return;
     this.age = age;
     isAdult = (age>=18);
  }
  ```
- `return-type` can be any data type,
- `void` means doesn't return any value,
- Follows `camelCase` naming convention,
- Method signature:
  - Combination of 
    - method `name`, and
    - its parameters 
      - `number`, 
      - `types`,
      - `order`,
  - `Modifiers`, `return-type`, and `parameter names` aren't part of the `signature`,
  - Ex:
    ```
     public int add(int num1, int num2){
        return num1+num2;
     }
    ```
    - Signature is: `add(int, int)`;
- Not allowed to have more than one method in a class with the same signature,
- A class can have `two types of method` like variables:
  - `Instant method` and 
  - `Class method`,

## Instance Method
- `Non-static` method,
- Used to implement `behavior of the objects` of the class,
- Must be `called using object`,
- Ex: See `showSpecificCharacter()` in `Hooman.java`,
  ```
  public void showSpecificCharacter(){
      System.out.println("Name is => "+name);
  }
  ```
  Accessing like this
  ```
  Hooman anik = new Hooman("Anik",22);
  anik.showSpecificCharacter(); // Name is => Anik
  ```

## Class Method
- `static` method,
- Used to implement the `behavior of the class` itself,
- Can be called using both `object` or `Class name`(Recommended) itself,
- Can't access instant variables here, guess why?
- Ex: See `showSomeCharacter()` in `Hooman.java`,
  ```
  public static void showSomeCharacter(){
    System.out.println("General characteristics");
    //System.out.println(name);//can't access instant variable here
  }
  ```
  Calling like this
  ```
  Hooman anik = new Hooman("Anik",22);
  anik.showSomeCharacter(); // General characteristics -------(a)
  Hooman.showSomeCharacter(); // General characteristics -----(b)
  ```
  - `(a)` is ok but `not recommended`,
  - `(b)` best practice,

## Special `main()` method
- Special method having `public`,`static`, `void`, method name `main` and having a `String array` as parameter,
  ```
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // entry point of execution
  }
  ```
- `JVM invokes this method`. If not found, then JVM does not know where to start the application. So, it throws an error stating that no main() method was found,
- You can have as many as `main()` method in a class having different signature. But JVM will call only the above one,
- You don't need to write main method in a class if you don't want it to start from here,
- You can also call `main()` method just like other method,
- Ex: See `Test.java`, 
  ```
  public class Test {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         ...
      }
      ...
  }
  ```

## Invoking/Calling method
- `Instance` method is invoked on an `instance of the class` using dot(`.`) notation,
- `Class method` is invoked on `Class name` using dot(`.`) notation,
- Ex: See `main()` in `Test.java`,
  ```
  Hooman anik = new Hooman("Anik",22);
  anik.showSpecificCharacter(); // instance
  
  Hooman.showSomeCharacter(); // static
  ```

## Constructor
- Used to `initialize an object` of a class,
- Constructor name is the same as the simple name of the class,
- Doesn't have return type,
- Basic Structure(can have `throws` clause also):
  ```
  <<Modifiers>> <<Constructor Name>>(<<parameters list>>){
   // Body of constructor goes here
  }
  ```
- Overloading of constructor is possible,
- If a class has multiple constructors, all of them must differ from the others in the `number`, `order`, or `type` of parameters,
- One constructor can call other constructor,
- `Access modifiers` are same as others,
- By default, `JVM` adds a `default constructor` as long as there is no constructor.
- `default constructor` doesn't accept any parameter and does nothing,
- `default constructor` only satisfies logic so that we can create object,
- You can't declare a constructor `static`. Remember `static` is part of class not object,
- Ex: See `Bird.java`,
  ```
  public class Bird {
      ...
      // constructor - 1
      public Bird() {
          this.name = "Unknown";
          this.species = "Not found";
          this.canFly = false;
      }
  
      // constructor - 2
      public Bird(boolean canFly) {
          this("unknown","Not found",canFly); // calling other constructor. Remember `this`. must be first line
      }
  
      // constructor - 3
      public Bird(String name, String species, boolean canFly) {
          this.name = name;
          this.species = species;
          this.canFly = canFly;
      }
  
      // constructor - 4 . Copy constructor
      public Bird(Bird bird){
          this.name = bird.name;
          this.species = bird.species;
          this.canFly = bird.canFly;
      }
      ...
  }
  ```
  Creating object like this: See `birdTest()` in `Test.java`:
  ```
    Bird deadBird = new Bird(); // 1
    deadBird.printDetails(); // Unknown -> Not found -> false
  
    Bird unknownBird = new Bird(true); // 2
    unknownBird.printDetails(); // Eagle -> Eagle -> true
  
    Bird eagle = new Bird("Eagle", "Eagle", true); // 3
    eagle.printDetails(); // Eagle -> Eagle -> true
  
    Bird secondEagle = new Bird(eagle); // 4
    secondEagle.printDetails(); // Eagle -> Eagle -> true
  ```

## Creating instance of a class
- Object can be created by calling its constructor.
- Ex: `new Hooman();`. This object will be automatically deleted, since we are not assigning it in any variable.
- When you create an object using `new` keyword, it allocates memory for each `instance field` of the class.
- Java runtime takes care of memory allocation, you don't need it.
- Creating object and calling method:
  ```
  Hooman saeed = new Hooman("Saeed",21);
  System.out.println(saeed.isAdult()); // true
  ```
